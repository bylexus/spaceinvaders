Space Invaders!
=================

A clone of the cult game, written for the web with [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io).

Work in Progress.

I planned to implement a 1:1 clone of the original Space Invaders. Turns out my family had other things in mind:

* I will create this game together with my kids: They're too young to program, but they can draw game assets!
* They loved the idea of Space Invaders, but it turned out that they had more fun if the foes fly by vertically.
  So this became a vertical shooter instead!

This is a work in progress. A first screenshot maybe:
